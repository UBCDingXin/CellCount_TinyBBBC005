The whole method is based on "Liu, Qian, et al. "A novel convolutional regression network for cell counting." 2019 IEEE 7th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (ICBCB). IEEE, 2019."

U-net is based on the FCRN-A in "Xie, Weidi, J. Alison Noble, and Andrew Zisserman. "Microscopy cell counting and detection with fully convolutional regression networks." Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering: Imaging & Visualization 6.3 (2018): 283-292.".

Actually not the U-Net like https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/

The arch in the Figure 3 of "Liu, Qian, et al. "A novel convolutional regression network for cell counting." 2019 IEEE 7th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (ICBCB). IEEE, 2019." does not work.
